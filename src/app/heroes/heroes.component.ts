  // Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.

  // To perform complex initializations shortly after construction.
  // To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties.

  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }// Constructors should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.
  // The parameter simultaneously defines a private heroService property and identifies it as a HeroService injection site.
  // When Angular creates a HeroesComponent, the Dependency Injection system sets the heroService parameter to the singleton
  // instance of HeroService.

  // Observable.subscribe() is the critical difference.
  // The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's heroes property.
  // The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server could return heroes instantly or
  // the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.
  // That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.
  // The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€” which could happen now or several minutes from now.
  // Then subscribe passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.
  // The .subscribe() function is similar to the .then() function in jQuery, but instead of dealing with promises it deals with Observables
  // That means it will subscribe itself to the observable of interest (which is getHeroes() in this case)
  // and wait until it is successful and then execute the passed callback function which in your case is: this.heroes = heroes
  // This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.

  // onSelect(hero: Hero): void {
  //   this.selectedHero = hero;
  // }

  add(name: string) {
    name = name.trim();

    this.heroService.addHero({ name } as Hero)
      .subscribe(hero => {
        this.heroes.push(hero);
      });
  }
  // When the given name is non-blank, the handler creates a Hero-like object from the name
  // (it's only missing the id) and passes it to the services addHero() method.
  // When addHero saves successfully, the subscribe callback receives the new hero and pushes it into to the heroes list for display.

  delete(hero: Hero) {
    this.heroes = this.heroes.filter(h => h !== hero);
    this.heroService.deleteHero(hero).subscribe();
    // If you neglect to subscribe(), the service will not send the delete request to the server!
    // As a rule, an Observable does nothing until something subscribes!
  }

  // The ngOnInit is a lifecycle hook.
  // Angular calls ngOnInit shortly after creating a component. It's a good place to put initialization logic.
  // Use ngOnInit() for two main reasons:
  // To perform complex initializations shortly after construction.
  // To set up the component after Angular sets the input properties.

  constructor(private heroService: HeroService) { }// Constructors should do no more than set the initial local variables to simple values.
  // The parameter simultaneously defines a private heroService property and identifies it as a HeroService injection site.
  // When Angular creates a HeroesComponent, the Dependency Injection system sets the heroService parameter to the singleton
  // instance of HeroService.

  // Observable.subscribe() is the critical difference.
  // The previous version assigns an array of heroes to the component's heroes property.
  // The assignment occurs synchronously, as if the server could return heroes instantly or
  // the browser could freeze the UI while it waited for the server's response.
  // That won't work when the HeroService is actually making requests of a remote server.
  // The new version waits for the Observable to emit the array of heroesâ€” which could happen now or several minutes from now.
  // Then subscribe passes the emitted array to the callback, which sets the component's heroes property.
  // This asynchronous approach will work when the HeroService requests heroes from the server.
